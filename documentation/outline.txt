What's the main idea?

The main idea is that we are talking about architecting cloud apps.

This is a report in software design.


Abstract
  As students we make things that last for only a weeklong assignment or a semester
  After working for a while on trash, development slows down
  What is it about bigger applications that things scale up

Introduction
  reference joel on software astronauts (rebuilding old stuff) so like if it is important
    not to, then we better make this stuff mantainable

Applications that Scale
  (maybe mention here that I made blodkorv but can't speak to it due to legal)
  (used by over 60 universities and touched by half a dozen engineers)
  (across FE, mobile, backend)

Items from that section:
  Removing State
  Repetition, Cons
  Traditional, not serverless -- Serverless
  Serverless vs Stateless
  IaC
  Env variables for config and infra location
  Maybe everything as code
  Maybe Cont delivery
