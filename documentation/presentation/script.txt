In the beginning.

At first, there were computers.
Well, not quite _at first_.
Computers as we know them today have only been around for a like 100 years.
Nevertheless.
At first, there were computers.

Then, humans discovered that computers are really good at stuff.
As a cascade of computer-tractable problems swept over humankind, our species realized that a single computer isolated from all the others was not enough.
So we built "The Cloud"
